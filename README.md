## Description
Hail Ya is an app that allows users to get weather information based on their location and time of their party, then receive drink recipes that will use the weather as one of the ingredients.  It takes in two inputs and hits two APIs to give the user the ultimate mother nature party.

#### Built in 4 hours at 'Hack the Planet' hackathon in Denver.
